/* ── The maintainer lock ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Flashing is disabled for everyone in this release, over and above the user's

   somebody makes and edits a test for, not something that happens because a
   line drifted during a merge.

   The lock is now computed from an unlock FILE rather than written as a
   literal, so the assertion is on the source and not on the runtime value.
   LSI_FLASH_LOCKED === true would pass or fail depending on whether the
   machine running the suite happens to have that file -- green in CI, red on
   the maintainer's own unlocked box, which is a test reporting where it ran
   rather than what the code says. What has to hold is the POLARITY: absent
   file means locked. Dropping the '!' is the mutant that matters, and it
   fails this.

   The source-order check is crude but it is the only property that matters and
   it cannot be tested any other way without HTTP: the 403 must come BEFORE any
   line that can reach flash_hba.sh. A lock placed after the dispatch is not a
   lock. Same technique bundle_coverage_test.sh already uses.
