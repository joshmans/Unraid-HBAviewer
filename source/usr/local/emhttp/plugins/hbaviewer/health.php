/* HBAviewer HBA Health — five sub-indicators with a worst-of rollup.
 *
 * scripts/get_hba_health.sh emits a stateless SAMPLE per controller (raw
 * readings + a timestamp, no judgement). Everything below is PURE over its
 * inputs: the ring append/reset rule, the rate arithmetic, the five state
 * rules, and the rollup — so tests/health_test.php exercises all of it with
 * no /tmp, no HTTP, no hardware. Only the store read/write pair touches a
 * path, and that path is always injectable.
 *
 * See event_archive.php for the persistence shape this copies. The one
 * deliberate difference: this ring lives in /tmp (RAM), not /boot, so there
 * is no conditional-write rule to defend flash wear — every sample is
 * appended unconditionally (see plan 020, "Write policy").
