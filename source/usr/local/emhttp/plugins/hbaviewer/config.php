/* ── Firmware flashing: maintainer lock ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Flashing is disabled outright, over and above the user's own ENABLE_FLASH
 * toggle, unless the unlock file below exists. No user's saved setting is
 * touched while the lock is on.
 *
 * ENABLE_FLASH is the USER saying "I might flash a card". This is the
 * MAINTAINER saying "not right now" — two different questions, so two
 * different switches rather than forcing the user's answer to a value they
 * did not choose and would silently lose on their next Save.
 *
 * Honoured at four places, and the order matters: flash.php refuses every
 * action with a 403 (the only one that is actually load-bearing — a UI that
 * merely looks disabled is not disabled), flash_view.php renders the reason
 * instead of the wizard, and settings.php greys the card and holds the stored
 * value. A page offering controls the endpoint would refuse is worse than one
 * that says plainly why there are none.
 *
 * Locked 2026-08-09: the flash path needs more testing on real hardware before
 * it is offered again. It is the one surface in this plugin that writes to a
 * controller, and a wrong image bricks it permanently — so the default while
 * in doubt is off.
 *
 * WHY A FILE AND NOT A CONSTANT. The lock has to be off on the box it is being
 * tested on and on for everyone else. Expressing that as a source difference
 * meant main and dev disagreeing about this line forever, and every merge
 * between them was a chance to ship the wrong value — the failure mode being
 * to silently hand a half-tested flasher to every user. A file moves the
 * difference off the branch and onto the machine, so the two branches carry
 * identical code and the default is locked no matter which one you install.
 *
 * It is not a security boundary and does not pretend to be: anyone who can
 * create this file already has root on the box and could run sas3flash by
 * hand. It guards against reaching the flasher by clicking, which is the
 * accident actually worth preventing.
 *
 * To test on your own machine:  touch /boot/config/plugins/hbaviewer/.flash-unlock
 * To lock it again:             rm   /boot/config/plugins/hbaviewer/.flash-unlock */
