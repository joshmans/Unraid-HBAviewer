# Unraid HBAviewer

Monitor LSI / Broadcom SAS Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) directly from Unraid —
temperature, PHY health, attached drives, SMART, the firmware event log, and
**real-time performance graphs** — across **four controller generations**, with
the correct backend auto-detected per card. An optional, opt-in **firmware/BIOS
update** tab is available for users who need it.

> Inspired by **[DevlinDelFuego](https://github.com/DevlinDelFuego/Unraid-LSIUtil)**
> for the SAS2308 / 9207-8i. This was a project I had been working on for a while with a similar capability but extends it to SAS3 (9300) and SAS3.5
> tri-mode (9400) controllers and multi-controller systems since I have SAS3 HBAs. I wanted something that had metrics and firmware/bios flashing capability so I had a bunch of scripts but didn't know how to tie it together cleanly until I saw Devlin's program.

## Supported hardware

The plugin detects the controller generation and uses the right tool automatically:

| Generation | Chipsets | Cards (examples) | Backend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SAS2** (6 Gb/s) | SAS2004 / 2008 / 2108 / 2116 / 2208 / 2308 | 9207-8i, 9211-8i, IBM M1015, Dell H200/H310 | `lsiutil` (bundled) |
| **SAS3** (12 Gb/s) | SAS3004 / 3008 / 3108 / 3216 / 3224 / 3316 | 9300-8i, 9305-16i, 9361-8i | `storcli` (system-installed) |
| **SAS3.5 / tri-mode** | SAS3408 / 3416 / 3508 / 3516 / 3616 / 3808 / 3816 | 9400-16i, 9400-8i, 9500 series | `storcli` (system-installed) |
| **SAS4 / tri-mode** (24 Gb/s) | SAS4016 / 4024 / 4116 | 9600-16i, 9600-24i, eHBA 9600 series | `storcli2` (system-installed) |

Multiple controllers are shown side by side. Both SAS and SATA drives are supported.

> **SAS3 and later need a Broadcom CLI** installed on the system — proprietary,
> so none of them are bundled here. SAS3 / SAS3.5 use `storcli`; **SAS4 / 9600
> cards use `StorCLI2`, which is a different program rather than a newer version
> of the same one** — the classic `storcli` cannot see a 9600 at all and reports
> zero controllers next to one. The
> **[storcli plugin by dkaser](https://github.com/dkaser/unraid-storcli)**
> (search **"storcli"** in *Community Applications*) ships both. SAS2 cards use
> the bundled `lsiutil` and need nothing extra.
>
> **9600-series support has not been run against real hardware in this repo.**
> It was ported from techanonymous's `Unraid-HBAviewer-sas4` fork (MIT), whose
> author verified it on their own 9600-24i — that is not the same claim as this

>
> ### Known limits on SAS4
>
> Per that verification, on a 9600-24i in eHBA personality the kernel registers
> no SAS transport class at all, which constrains three things:
>
> - **Locate and the Array Map are unavailable.** Both key on SAS addresses, which
>   the card does not publish to the kernel.
> - **The Performance tab's link-error series reads as unmeasured**, not zero. That
>   poll only touches instant sources, and the counters are not among them there.
>   PHY Health does show them — it can afford to ask the controller.
> - **The Event Log needs Broadcom's full StorCLI2.** The Lite build that the
>   dkaser plugin ships answers that command with *"Un-supported command"*, and
>   the tab says so rather than showing an empty table that would read like a
>   healthy log. See [Installation](#installation) for the optional full build.

## Features

- **Overview** — per-controller temperature gauge with a configurable alert
  threshold, plus a real **health rollup** (goes yellow/red on high temp, a
  failed drive, or PHY errors — not just heat). Shows chip, firmware, BIOS,
  driver version, IT/IR mode, connected-drive count, and PCIe info. Pre-P20
  SAS2 firmware is flagged; cards with no onboard sensor show `N/A · no sensor`
  instead of erroring.
- **HBA Health** — five independent indicators (thermal, link integrity,
  topology, host link, controller read) with a **worst-of** rollup and a reason
  string naming the offending PHY. An indicator that cannot be measured reads
  **grey/unknown**, never green — a collector that times out or a card that is
  pulled must not look healthy.
- **PHY Health** — per-PHY link state, negotiated speed, attached SAS address,
  and error counters (invalid DWords, disparity, loss-of-sync, reset) — read
  from the controller (lsiutil) or from Linux `sysfs` (`mpt3sas`) on SAS3/3.5.
  **Set a baseline** per controller and every counter is then shown as a delta
  and an errors/hour rate, so "40,000 invalid DWords two months ago" stops
  looking like "40,000 last night". The baseline lives on `/boot` and survives
  reboots; a reboot or driver reload invalidates it rather than reporting a
  negative delta.
- **Top offenders** — above the PHY table, the PHYs with the highest error rate
  since the baseline, each **named by the drive it serves** (enclosure/slot, or
  `/dev/sdX` on SAS2). PHYs with no baseline are excluded rather than ranked at
  zero — zero would read as "measured and clean" when it means "never measured".
- **Attached Drives** — `/dev` name, **what Unraid calls the disk** (`Parity`,
  `Disk 1`, `Cache`), enclosure/slot, HBA port, model, serial, state, size,
  SAS address, link speed, firmware, and a **per-drive SMART** button. The
  `/dev` name and the Unraid slot appear on the PHY and SMART tables too, so a
  row here can be matched against the Main page without tracking `sdX` by eye.
- **Array Map** — a grid of the physical bays, arranged the way they sit in
  the chassis, so a problem drive is a place you can walk to rather than a slot
  number. You place each drive once — drag it into its bay, or click the drive
  then the bay — and the layout is saved to `/boot`; **lock it** when you are
  done so a stray click cannot undo it. **Copy map** puts the layout on your
  clipboard so it can live somewhere other than the flash drive, **Restore map**
  rebuilds it from that text, and **Undo** covers a mistaken Clear or resize. Colour is the signal: bays stay neutral until something needs
  attention, a temperature bar makes a hot row visible without reading every
  number, empty bays are drawn as empty bays, and a disk being rebuilt into
  parity shows as such. Nothing on the machine knows your chassis layout — on a
  direct-attach backplane the enclosure/slot addressing is invented by the
  controller — so this is the one thing the plugin cannot work out for you.
- **Locate a drive** — blink one drive's **activity light** from the Drives
  table or a bay on the Array Map, so a row becomes a bay you can walk to. Needs no
  SES, no enclosure processor and no GPIO — it works by reading the drive twice
  a second, so anything with a tray light can be found, including plain HBAs on
  dumb backplanes. Stops itself after five minutes so a forgotten blink cannot
  keep a disk awake indefinitely.
- **SMART tab** — health, temperature, grown defects, pending sectors, and
  power-on hours for every drive, collected **in the background** so it never
  blocks the UI and (on SAS) **never spins up a standby drive**. The collection
  is **kept until you press Refresh** rather than expiring on a timer — reading
  every drive takes ~1 s each and the numbers change over weeks — and every
  screen that shows it states how old it is.
- **Event Log** — the firmware event log, **archived to `/boot`** so history
  survives reboots and firmware ring-buffer wrap, with copy-to-clipboard for
  support tickets.
- **Enclosure / topology** — an enclosure summary per controller (direct-attach
  vs expander/backplane).
- **Dashboard tile** — at-a-glance temperature and health on the Unraid
  dashboard (Unraid 7.2+).
- **Notifications** *(opt-in, off by default)* — sends one Unraid notification
  each time a controller's health status **changes**, and never repeats while it
  stays the same. Delivery follows your existing Unraid notification settings.
- **Diagnostic bundle** — one button collects the raw `storcli`/`lsiutil`
  output, the sysfs state and the plugin's own parsed JSON into a single archive
  for a bug report. **Anonymised by default** with one length-preserving map for
  the whole bundle, so serials, WWNs, SAS addresses and the hostname are
  replaced while models, sizes, firmware versions, temperatures and error
  counters stay real. Your flash GUID, licence key and share names are never
  collected at all.
- **Export / API** — a read-only JSON snapshot of every controller
  (`/plugins/hbaviewer/export.php`) plus the same data in Prometheus text format
  (`?format=prometheus`), for Homepage-style widgets and dashboards. Both are
  **session-gated**, so an unauthenticated Prometheus scraper cannot poll them —
  see [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md#export--api).
- **Performance graphs** *(real-time, in-browser)* — live per-controller
  throughput, IOPS, %util, latency, PHY error-rate, and temperature, sampled
  ~2 s from `/proc/diskstats` and `sysfs` (zero-dependency — no sampler daemon,
  no flash writes; history lives in the browser and resets on reload).
- **Firmware / BIOS Update** *(advanced, opt-in, off by default)* — an assisted
  flash page that detects the card + running firmware, runs a read-only
  per-card sanity check, takes your model-correct image, and flashes that one
  card behind hard guardrails with a live log. See the safety section below.

All *monitoring* data is read directly from the HBA (`storcli` / `lsiutil`),
Linux `sysfs`, and `smartctl` — no agents, no polling daemons, no external calls.

## Firmware / BIOS updates (advanced, opt-in)

> **⚠ Flashing HBA firmware can permanently brick your controller.** This
> feature is **off by default** and is for users who already know how to flash
> an LSI/Broadcom HBA from a console. If you are not sure, do not enable it.

HBAviewer is otherwise strictly read-only. The optional **Firmware/BIOS Update**
tab is *assisted, not automatic*: it detects the card and runs the tools, but
**you** supply the model-correct firmware image and (if not already installed)
the flash tool.

**Enabling it:** Settings → *Advanced — Firmware Flashing* → tick
**Enable firmware/BIOS flashing** → Save. A red **Firmware/BIOS Update** button
then appears at the bottom of that same Settings page, and is the only way in —
the Monitor does not link to it. Reaching the one screen that writes to hardware
means coming back past the warning that explains what it costs to get wrong.

**How a flash works, per card:**

1. **Verify** — a read-only listing **scoped to that one card** (`storcli /cN show`
   or `sasNflash -c N -list`) confirms the tool sees the exact card you're about to flash.
2. **Choose the image** — the exact firmware `.bin`/`.rom` for *your* model
   (optionally a BIOS `.rom`). There is no upload button: you copy the files into
   `/boot/config/plugins/hbaviewer/flash` yourself and the page offers what it
   finds there. The `sas2flash`/`sas3flash` binary goes in the same folder if it
   isn't already in `PATH`.
3. **Confirm & flash** — tick the acknowledgement, type `FLASH`, and flash. A
   live log streams; on success it prompts you to **reboot**.

**A dual-controller board is one card, and is flashed as one.** A SAS9300-16i is
a single board carrying two SAS3008 controllers, so the page shows it as one
entry — `Controller /c0, /c1` — and the flash writes both **in sequence** from
the one image you selected. Only that card's own controllers are written, never
every controller in the box. If the second write fails after the first
succeeded, the page raises a distinct **partial flash** banner telling you not to
reboot and to re-run the flash for the whole card; see
[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md#flash-firmware-or-bios).

**Tools used** (auto-detected in `PATH`, or drop them in the flash folder — none
are bundled):

| Generation | Chip | Flash tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SAS2 (9200/9211/2308) | `SAS2xxx` | `sas2flash` |
| SAS3 (9300/9305) | `SAS30xx`/`SAS31xx` | `sas3flash` |
| SAS3.5 / 9400 tri-mode | `SAS34xx`/`SAS35xx` | `storcli /cN download` |

**Guardrails (all enforced server-side, not just in the browser):**

- Opt-in toggle gates the whole feature (default off).
- The Unraid **array must be STOPPED** — the flash is refused otherwise.
- Read-only verify first, **scoped to the target card**, so you flash the card
  you actually confirmed — not another HBA in the box.
- The controllers you name must **be one of this server's cards**, re-derived
  from the live hardware at flash time — half of a dual-IOC board is refused,
  and so is any list that is not a card.
- Explicit acknowledgement checkbox **and** a typed `FLASH` confirmation.
- Single-flight lock — one flash at a time, never auto-retried.
- Filenames are sanitised and confined to the fixed flash folder.

**Caveats — read these:**

- **Bricking is a real, unavoidable risk** if the image doesn't match the card.
  Double-check the model/chip against the image before you flash.
- The flash tools are **proprietary** and per-generation — not shipped with the
  plugin. Install them (e.g. via a storcli/flash plugin) or copy them into
  `/boot/config/plugins/hbaviewer/flash` yourself.
- Some SAS2 cards need a specific `sas2flash` build (e.g. a 9207-8i wants the P14
  tool). Use the right one; the plugin won't second-guess it.
- storcli 94xx flashing semantics vary by firmware package (a downrev may need
  `noverchk`); the log is shown verbatim — treat it as best-effort.
- Linux flashers **update** the BIOS region but **cannot erase** it.
- Stop any Unassigned Devices on the HBA as well before flashing.

| Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| **[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md)** | Task-oriented guide — install, first run, finding the drive behind a failing PHY, mapping your drive bays, baselines, the export endpoint, generating a bug-report bundle, and troubleshooting. |
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** | How the plugin is built — backend selection, the parse layer, request lifecycle, caching, the mutating paths, and the test strategy. Read this before changing code. |
| `source/.../CONTEXT.md` | Module vocabulary — the short definitions the code assumes you already know. |

## Requirements

- Unraid 6.12 or newer (7.2+ for the dashboard tile)
- A supported LSI / Broadcom SAS controller (see the table above)
- For **SAS3 / SAS3.5** cards: `storcli` installed — easiest via the
  [dkaser/unraid-storcli](https://github.com/dkaser/unraid-storcli) plugin
  (search "storcli" in Community Applications)
- For **SAS4 / 9600** cards: `StorCLI2` installed — a different program from
  `storcli`, not a newer one. The same dkaser plugin ships it, but only its
  *Lite* build; the firmware Event Log needs Broadcom's full StorCLI2, which
  is optional and installed by hand — see [Installation](#installation).
- `smartctl` (ships with Unraid) for the SMART features
- The `lsiutil` binary for SAS2 cards is bundled in the `.txz` — nothing extra
  is downloaded

## Installation

1. In the Unraid web UI go to **Plugins → Install Plugin**
2. Paste the plugin URL:

    ```text
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FugginOld/Unraid-HBAviewer/main/hbaviewer.plg
    ```

3. Click **Install**

If you have a **SAS3 or newer** card, install the Broadcom CLI it needs — search
**"storcli"** in *Community Applications* and install
[dkaser's storcli plugin](https://github.com/dkaser/unraid-storcli); it ships
both `storcli` and `storcli2` and puts them on `PATH`, which is all this plugin
needs — it probes for whichever one can actually read your card rather than
guessing from the name.

That covers every tab on a **SAS4 / 9600** card *except the firmware Event
Log*, because the `storcli2` build the dkaser plugin ships is the
feature-reduced *Lite* one. If you want the Event Log too, install Broadcom's
full StorCLI2 as well — it cannot be redistributed here (proprietary) or
fetched automatically (its download page is JavaScript-driven behind bot
protection, with no stable direct URL), so you fetch the archive yourself:

1. Download **StorCLI2** from Broadcom and copy the `.zip` onto the server —
   any share will do.
2. On **the server** (Unraid terminal or SSH — not your desktop), run:

    ```bash
    bash /usr/local/emhttp/plugins/hbaviewer/scripts/install_storcli2.sh /path/to/StorCLI2.zip
    ```

   It unpacks the archive (a `.deb`, `.rpm` or a bare binary work too), checks
   the binary really is StorCLI2, copies it to
   `/boot/config/plugins/hbaviewer/tools/` so it survives a reboot, and adds
   three lines to `/boot/config/go` that restore it at boot — `/opt` is RAM
   here and the flash is FAT32, so it cannot keep the execute bit. It backs
   `go` up first, is safe to re-run, and takes `--no-go` if you would rather
   do that part yourself.

   **Settings → HBA Connection → Firmware Event Log** shows these same steps
   and whether the full build is currently installed.

After installation, find the monitor under **Tools → Disk Utilities → HBA Monitor**.

    └── HBA Monitor   (tabs: Overview · HBA Health · PHY Health · Drives

                        *opt-in, off by default; the page and its menu entry

Dashboard
└── HBA Temperature tile (Unraid 7.2+)
```

## Configuration

Open **User Utilities → HBAviewer**. The settings page opens instantly and shows
the detected **Access Method** (`StorCLI2`, `storcli` or `lsiutil`) so you can
confirm the right backend is in use before opening the Monitor.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access Method | (auto) | Read-only. Shows which backend is in use — `StorCLI2` (SAS4), `storcli` (SAS3/3.5) or `lsiutil` (SAS2) — and warns if a card is found but the tool it needs isn't installed. |
| lsiutil Port (fallback) | 1 | *SAS2 only* — every card lsiutil lists is read automatically, so this normally does nothing. It names the one port to fall back to if that list cannot be read. Only shown if SAS2 cards are detected. |
| Alert Threshold | 80 °C | The badge turns red (ALERT) at or above this temperature. |
| Show PCIe Info | On | PCIe width/speed row in the Overview. |
| Show PHY Health | On | PHY tab. |
| Show Attached Drives | On | Drives tab. |
| Show Event Log | On | Event Log tab. |
| Show Performance | On | Performance tab — real-time throughput / IOPS / %util / latency / PHY-error-rate / temperature graphs (in-browser, resets on reload). |
| Enable notifications | **Off** | Sends an Unraid notification when a controller's health status changes (checked every 10 minutes). One notification per change, never a repeat while it persists. |
| Enable firmware/BIOS flashing | **Off** | *Advanced.* Unlocks the Firmware/BIOS Update page and the button that reaches it. Read the [firmware section](#firmware--bios-updates-advanced-opt-in) before enabling — flashing can brick a card. |

The **drive bay map** deliberately has no row on this page. Its grid size and
its lock live with the map itself (the **Array Map** tab), because a layout is
something you build while looking at it, not a number you set on one page and
go check on another. They are still persisted the same way everything else here
is.

Save your settings, then click **Open HBAviewer Monitor**. The Monitor page opens
immediately with a **"Loading HBA information"** banner and reads the hardware in
the background — the first read can take up to a minute on slow controllers, and
the page fills in automatically when it's ready (no blank hang, no timeout).

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FugginOld/Unraid-HBAviewer.git
cd Unraid-HBAviewer

# Fetch the lsiutil binary and build the .txz (see build.sh for details)
bash build.sh

# build.sh prints the MD5 and version to update in hbaviewer.plg
```

The bundled `hbaviewer.x86_64` is the original `lsiutil` v1.70 compiled for Linux
x86-64. `storcli` is **not** bundled — SAS3/3.5 cards use the copy installed on
your system. `build.sh` also fetches **Chart.js** (the Performance tab's charting
library, MIT) into the plugin dir; like the `lsiutil` binary it isn't committed
to the repo. The Performance tab degrades gracefully with a message if it's absent.

## Testing

The shell parsers and PHP helpers have a golden-file test suite that needs no
hardware:

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
```

It runs the parser goldens plus the PHP unit tests (using a local `php`, or the
`php:8.2-cli` Docker image if `php` isn't installed), and needs GNU awk.

CI additionally syntax-checks every language the plugin ships — `php -l`,
`bash -n`, `node --check` — and runs ShellCheck, PHPStan and actionlint on top.

Fixtures are **real controller output wherever possible** — captured with the
`scripts/capture*.sh` helpers or contributed by reporters on the issue tracker,
with identifiers masked length-preservingly so column alignment (which the
parsers key on) survives. A fixture that was modelled by hand rather than
captured has caused a real bug here before, so treat fixtures as evidence
rather than as editable test data.
